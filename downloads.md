## Downloads

If you're looking to use one of my projects without bothering to compile it from source, there are some options available:

### crates.io

Some of my projects get published to [crates.io](https://crates.io) when their version bumps, and you can install them by installing [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and running `cargo install <name>` in your terminal.

#### Applications

- [eidolon](https://crates.io/crates/eidolon)

- [raven](https://crates.io/crates/raventhemer). Note: raven is published under the name raventhemer instead of raven, due to naming conflicts.

- [wyvern](https://crates.io/crates/wyvern)

#### Libraries

- [butlerd-rs](https://crates.io/crates/butlerd)

- [gog-rs](https://crates.io/crates/gog)

- [ravenlib](https://crates.io/crates/ravenlib)

### Pre-Compiled Binaries

These projects are available, automatically compiled from the latest git commit. Checksums for all are [here](https://demenses.net/checksums). These are built using the wonderful [builds.sr.ht](https://builds.sr.ht)

- [raven](https://demenses.net/raven-nightly) and [ravend](https://demenses.net/ravend-nightly)

- [eidolon](https://demenses.net/eidolon-nightly)
